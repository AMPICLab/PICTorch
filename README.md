# PICTorch

PICTorch is a built upon the Photontorch simulator to enable free, open-source and rapid simulation of Silicon Photonic integrated circuits (PICs). The code extensions contains a set of libraries of components and process primitives which can be customized to any foundry process. PICTorch leverages the PyTorch framework for computation upon which Photontorch is built.

## Installation

Install photontorch and its dependencies. 


## Things To Do
1. Add netlist based simulation capability and use a GUI program such as xschem to generate netlists from schematics.
2. Enable co-integration with ngspice or similar tool for co-simulation with electronics.
3. Create a generic PDK file for SiP processes.
4. Convert APD synthesis Matlab code to Python
5. Add filter synthesis code for CROW and SCISSOR topologies
