# PICTorch

PICTorch is a fork of the Photontorch simulator to enable free, open-source and rapid simulation of silicon photonic integrated circuits (PICs). The code extensions contains a set of libraries of components and process primitives which can be customized to any foundry process.

Photontorch is a photonic simulator for highly parallel simulation and optimization of photonic circuits in time and frequency domain.
Photontorch features CUDA enabled simulation and optimization of photonic circuits. It leverages the deep learning framework PyTorch to view the photonic circuit as essentially a recurrent neural network.
This enables the use of native PyTorch optimizers to optimize the (physical) parameters of the circuit.

## Installation

### Stable version

Photontorch can be installed with pip:

```
pip install photontorch
```

### Development version

During development or to use the most recent Photontorch version,
clone the repository and link with pip:

```
git clone https://git.photontorch.com/photontorch.git
./install-git-hooks.sh # Unix [Linux/Mac/BSD/...]
install-git-hooks.bat  # Windows
pip install -e photontorch
```

During development, use pytest to run the tests from within the root
of the git-repository:

```
pytest tests
```

## Reference

If you're using PICTorch fork of Photontorch for your research, product development work or otherwise, we ask you to cite the following two references in your work:

and optimization of photonic circuits in time and frequency domain based on the
deep-learning framework PyTorch."_ Scientific reports 9.1 (2019): 5918.

## Things To Do
Add netlist based simulation capability and use a GUI program to generate netlists from schematics.
Enable co-integration with ngspice or similar tool for co-simulation with electronics.
Create a generic PDK file for SiP processes.


## Known issues

- Complex tensor support. Complex tensors are not supported in
  PyTorch/Photontorch. Wherever complex tensors would be applicable,
  Photontorch expects a real-valued tensor with the real and imag part
  stacked in the first dimension. The Photontorch issue can be
  followed [here](https://github.com/flaport/photontorch/issues/4) and
  the PyTorch issue [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/755).
- Sparse tensor support. A lot of memory usage can probably be avoided
  when transitioning to a sparse tensor representation for the connection matrices and
  scatter matrices. The Photontorch issue can be followed [here](https://github.com/flaport/photontorch/issues/5)
